# MIT Legal Discussion Group on AI

This MIT Legal Forum small group discussion series focuses on **"AI, Computational and Autonomous Systems"** in the context of law and legal processes.  

**Black Mirror Screening and Discussion**

This group periodicaly convenes discussion around "anchor scenarios" from the Black Mirror NetFlix series and other SciFi based popular media, cinema or books.  Anchor scenarios can enable deeper discussion by quickly conveying an understandable set of facts and situations involving the technology and giving rise to key legal issues.  Anchor scenarios are selected for their capability to spotlight key social, ethical, governance, political, economic, constitutional and other challenges potentially resulting from rapid and widespread adoption of advanced technologies.
